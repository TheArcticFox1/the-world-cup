    <p>In the small village of Theuley-les-Lavoncourt in eastern France stands a monument to a local
    man who changed the world. The monument takes the form of a grassed football penalty area, complete
    with a replica goal, and a portrait of a man who never kicked a ball in anger in his life. His name
    was Jules Rimet. Of all the Frenchmen who touched the consciousness of the world in the last
    century - Charles de Gaulle, Henri Matisse, Marcel Proust - M. Rimet reached more people, in more
    countries, more lastingly than any other. His child - or monster - will make one of its four-yearly
    explosions into the world's rapt gaze from this Friday. M. Rimet, a grocer's son who became a
    lawyer, invented the World Cup. His grandson, Yves Rimet, 74, who remembers his grandfather well,
    describes him as a "humanist and idealist, who believed that sport could unite the world. Unlike
    many others in his time, he realised that, to be truly democratic, to truly engage the masses,
    international sport must be professional. All the same," M. Rimet said. "my grandfather would have been disappointed with the money-dominated business that football has become. That was not his vision." To the end of his life in 1956, Jules Rimet predicted that international football would re-create the spirit of medieval "chivalry". Sport - and above all football - would be the means to teach the world's masses to appreciate the
    Christian virtues of hard work, honesty, obedience to rules, comradeship and fair play.</p>

<p>Jules Rimet was a French football administrator and a qualified Lawyer. He was the 3rd President of FIFA, serving from 1921 to 1954. He is FIFA's longest-serving president, in office for 33 years. He also served as the president of the French Football Federation from 1919 to 1942. On Rimet's initiative, the first FIFA World Cup was held in 1930. The Jules Rimet Trophy was named in his honour. He also founded French club Red Star, known as Red Star Club Français upon its creation in 1897. Jules Rimet was born in 1873 in the commune of Theuley, in the department of Haute-Saône in eastern France. His father was a grocer, and the family moved to Paris in 1884 when Jules was eleven years old. He became a lawyer, and in 1897 he started a sports club called Red Star which, due to Rimet's ideals, did not discriminate against its members on the basis of class. One of the sports played at the club was football, which was becoming popular. When he was 17, Pope Leo XIII released his encyclical on the dignity of work, Rerum novarum, which would have a profound effect on the young Catholic Rimet, and sparked his efforts to promote these views.</p>

-Football and FIFA-
<p>Rimet was involved in the founding of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (International Federation of Association Football, commonly abbreviated to FIFA) in 1904, and, while the fledgling organisation had plans for a global professional tournament, it instead was involved in running an amateur tournament as part of the 1908 Summer Olympics. The First World War put Rimet's and FIFA's plans on hold. Rimet served in the French Army as an officer and was decorated with a Croix de Guerre.  Following the war in 1919, he became President of the French Football Federation, and then President of FIFA on 1 March 1921 Rimet would hold the post until 1954 becoming the longest reigning President to date, taking the membership of the organisation from 12 up to 85 nations, despite losing the membership of the English, Welsh and Scottish Football Associations during the early years. After taking up the post he moved once again to start a global tournament, but was opposed by the amateur football associations and Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee.</p>

<p>In 1928 FIFA, under Rimet's leadership, went forward with plans for a "World Cup" which was held in Uruguay due to the nature of the professional game in South America, and in part because the Uruguayan Football Association offered to pay all travel costs. Rimet travelled to Uruguay for the World Cup on SS Conte Verde along with the competing European teams, all the while carrying the trophy in his bag.  However Rimet's decisions on where to host the first few World Cups led to criticism: European nations complained about the 1930 World Cup because players would be out of domestic tournaments for three months. This was the key reason why, of the European nations, only four (France, Belgium, Romania and Yugoslavia) accepted invitations to send teams to compete, and even then, they only did so because of Rimet's influence. The following World Cup was held in Italy under the Fascist rule of Benito Mussolini, which was used to promote the regime, something that Rimet was accused of ignoring. Following the Second World War, the British football associations agreed to take part from the 1950 FIFA World Cup onwards, where Rimet himself handed over the trophy to the triumphant Uruguayan team when Uruguay won the tournament for the second time. Rimet's efforts in establishing the tournament earned him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1956.</p>

<p>-Later life and legacy-
Rimet died in Suresnes, France in 1956, two days after his 83rd birthday. In 2004, he was posthumously made a member of
the FIFA Order of Merit, which was collected by his grandson Yves Rimet. He is credited with being the inventor of the
World Cup. The original World Cup trophy was named the Jules Rimet Trophy in his honour. It was stolen just prior to the 1966 World Cup in England, but was found by the dog Pickles. Brazil won the tournament for the third time at the 1970 World Cup and were awarded the trophy permanently. It was stolen again in Rio de Janeiro in 1983; while it is believed to have been melted down by the thieves, there is no conclusive proof of this. The Brazilian Football Confederation subsequently had a replica of the trophy made. Rumours of the various disappearances of the trophy, and its final resting place, still persist.  A statue of Rimet stands in Theuley in the middle of a penalty box, complete with goal. Rimet was portrayed by Academy Award-nominated French actor Gérard Depardieu in the 2014 biographical drama United Passions.</p>

<p>The Jules Rimet Cup was the original trophy of the FIFA World Cup. Originally called "Victory", but generally known
    simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in
    1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. It was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base. In 1954 the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winner's details. It stood 35 centimetres (14 in) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb). 
    
    It comprised of a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just south east of Nice, in June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup.</p>

<p>This trophy was renamed for Rimet in 1946. During World War II, the trophy was held by
    1938 champion Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian vice-president of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden marked the beginning of a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographers' requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.</p>

</div>

<p>On 20 March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public
exhibition at Westminster Central Hall. It was found seven days later wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a
suburban garden hedge in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by a black and white mongrel dog named
Pickles. As a security measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured a replica of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA for the next competition. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000 to £30,000, was lead by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Testing by FIFA confirmed the auctioned trophy was a replica. Soon afterwards FIFA arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.</p>

<p>The Brazilian team won the tournament for the third time in 1970, allowing them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass. On 19 December 1983, the wooden rear of the cabinet was opened by force with a crowbar and the cup was stolen again. Four men were tried and convicted in absentia for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and it is widely believed to have been melted down and sold.Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base, which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Zürich headquarters prior to 2015. The Confederation commissioned a replica of their own, made by Eastman Kodak, using 1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb) of gold. This replica was presented to Brazilian military president João Figueiredo in 1984.</p>

<p>A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from
sculptors in seven countries.[18][20] Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands 36.5 centimetres (14.4 in) tall and is made of 6.175 kilograms (13.61 lb) of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately
US$161,000 in 2018. Its base is 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in diameter containing two layers of malachite. Chemist Sir
Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh 70–80 kilograms
(150–180 lb) and would be too heavy to lift. This is easy to understand since 18 k gold is an alloy made of 18
parts of gold, 5 parts of silver and 1 part of copper with a mean density of 15.6 g/cm3.The trophy weighs 6175
g, this amount of alloy is just a volume of 390 cm3 or, in other words, would be a cube with a side of 7.3 cm, and the
World Cup is clearly larger. This argumentation proves that the World Cup is indeed hollow. Moreover, its original
manufacturer, who is the same that makes the official replicas, confirmed this characteristic.

Produced by Bertoni, Milano in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described
the trophy thus, "The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the
remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment
of victory". The trophy has the engraving "FIFA World Cup" on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy where the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The original trophy is now permanently kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Zurich,
Switzerland. It only leaves there when it goes on its FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour. It is present at the Final draw for
the next World Cup, and on the pitch at the World Cup opening game and Final. The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour was
inaugurated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup competition.</p>

</div>

<p>The Cup used to be kept by the winning team until the final draw of the next tournament, however, that is no longer the
case. Instead the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold.
Likewise, three-time winners keep the replica instead of the original cup. Germany became the first nation to win
the new trophy for the third time when they won the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Argentina became the second nation to
achieve this feat following their win in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>

<p>The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language. For example,
"1974 Deutschland" or "1994 Brasil". In 2010, the name of the winning nation was engraved as "2010 Spain", in English,
not in Spanish. This was corrected in the new plate made after the 2018 World Cup.
As of 2022, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of
the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners.
Since the base of the trophy only has space for new engravings to be made up until the 2038 World Cup, a new trophy will
eventually be made for the 2042 World Cup.</p>

<p>Jules Rimet was the 3rd president of FIFA who served in the position from 1921 until 1954 - a tenure of 33 years.</p>
